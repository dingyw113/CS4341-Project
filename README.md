Made by Team Cohort X <br/>
<br/>
Team member: Yiwei Ding, Brendan Anderson, Sam Ofiaza, Syed Qaddri and Wonjin Choi

Project Part1 <br/>
<br/>
Implement Gate-based Code <br/>
Turning a truth table into a set of equations in a simulation in Verilog using a structure programming style.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Project Part2 <br/>
<br/>
Build a combination logic circuit<br/>
Write the Verilog code that matches the circuit designed<br/>
Code begins with a testbench and a breadboard<br/>
Modules will be created for the adder/subtractor/multiplication, the division, the modulo, the decoder, and the multiplexor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How to run it
-                 iverilog -o file_name.vvp file.name.v                
-                          vvp file_name.vvp
